I want to build a full fledged semantic engine for resume analysis. 
I have all the resume data available. I would like the LLM to run analysis on the 
entire resume and come with corrections if required; such as typos, grammar, tone etc
I want the LLM to act as a recruiter based on the users designation and provide outputs.
After saving resume, I want the user to click on Analyze and that process will take a 
snapshot of the resume at that time and feed it to the LLM for analysis. 
I want these LLM results to show up on their respective resume sections with different colors,
backgrounds and colors.
